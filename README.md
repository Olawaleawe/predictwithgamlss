## Predicting Oil Price with Gamlss
The objective of this excercise is to conduct a probalistic forecast of oil price using gamlss model selection technique to discover the most important variables that affects the price of oil. Based on real global events, non-seasonality of oil price, among other issues, there is currently no known best method for predicting Oil prices in literature, therefore, oil companies and oil service companies will have to adapt to recent world activities that impact oil production. There are several variables that can indirectly impact oil prices. The main goal here is to use some financially traded vagaries to discover what might affect the daily dynamics of the price of oil by using GAMLSS model selection techniques to discover what affects the price of oil and obtain a one day ahead forecast. Due to the the "No free lunch theorem" and the "Bias-Variance Trade off" in machine learning, it is difficult to select and adopt a single model for forecasting but we fit basic models in this exercise mainly for illustrative purposes.
